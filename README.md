## Design

The primary design goal of Vissta Sphere was to ensure clear categorization of products, memberships, and subscription options. The website must distinctly separate the eCommerce store from other sections, making it easy for users to navigate and shop.

The main objective of the website design was to provide an incredibly user-friendly and efficient navigation experience. This was achieved through an intuitive product filtering system, related item suggestions, and a responsive, clean navigation menu. Links throughout various areas of the site also provide easy return navigation options.

We focused on creating a clear distinction between authenticated and non-authenticated users. Authenticated users can access additional content, view order history, manage memberships, and update personal information.

The design ensures consistency across all pages while providing a unique feel for each section. This was achieved through reusable components, consistent color schemes, buttons, forms, and other UI elements. The goal was for users to feel as though they were enjoying a fun and engaging shopping experience, much like browsing a physical store.

This commitment to intuitive navigation and user-centered design remained at the forefront of the projectâ€™s development.

In order to enhance development style I researched different styling options via Bootstrap template examples and was greatly inspired by [StartBootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com/templates/ecommerce)

### Colour Scheme

The websites colour theme closly mimics Code Institutes colour theme. The use of orange, black, white and grey are the primary colours to help mimic the feel. Action components such as checkout, pay now or update forms are clearly distinguished with a bold blue or green colour, while all other less important/navigation buttons are consistant with the theme.

![Colour Scheme](./documentation/images/colour%20theme.png)

### Database Schema

![Database schema](./documentation/images/dbdiagram.png)

### Models

#### Allauth User Model

The User model is an integral component of Django Allauth, featuring pre-established fields as part of its standard configuration. Among these fields are username, email, name, password, and others. This model primarily serves the purpose of user authentication, which is why it is not recommended to make direct alterations to it. Furthermore, the User model is linked to the Profile model through a one-to-one relationship, facilitating the management of user-specific data and interactions.

#### Profile Model

Profile Model: The Profile Model provides a snapshot of each user's presence on the platform, encapsulating their user information, delivery information and order history. It is has a one to one relationship with the auth User Model.

#### Category Model

The Category Model categorises products and programs, ensuring users can easily discover relatable products/programs.

#### Product Model

The Product Model is one of the main models of the application and is closely similar to the program model. It includes image, price, name, description, sku, discounts, sale and rating.

#### Program Model

The program model contains all fields of the product model with extra field such as difficulty, videourl and length that are unique to it.

#### Module Model

The moduel model is linked closely to the program model. A module contains a tile and description and is linked to a program

#### Subscription Model

The subscription model is a model that holds information about a users membership. It has one to many relationship with a userprofile. A subscription contains discounts amounts on products and programs.

#### Order Model

The Order model contains information about a purchase. It contains lineitems of products. Products are based on a generic key type as they can be either products, programs or subscriptions. Its fields are date, lineitems, delivery, user and total cost.

#### OrderLine Item

The Order Line Item model is linked to the Order Model. Its fields are an FK to an order, the content_type, object_id, content_object, quantity, total, discount and item total.

### Fonts

The font used in this project is Segoe UI Roboto, which give a standard feel as mimiced in the CI website. <br>
![Font](./documentation/images/font-family.png)

### Wireframes

#### Desktop


#### Mobile


#### Late Design Changes

A key late design change was to alter the Phonenumber field within the Profile model. This was both linked to orders and user profiles. An issue was dealing with accessibiliy of the country selector phone number code and the entry of the number in a standardised format to the Order model. The result was removing this feature and instead prompting the user to fill in an international number with error context rendered.

## Features

### Navigation Header

The navigation bar is a consistent element across all pages, designed using Bootstrap and optimised for full responsiveness. The left is centered around navigation of content while the right hand side is related to user authentication. Authenticated users can also see create posts and view profile links while unauthenticated users only see a prompt to login/register.

The mobile version of the navbar has all the content rendered when a hamburger icon is clicked. When clicked a dropdown display is rendered showing all navigation links.

<details><summary>Mobile</summary>
<img src="./documentation/images/features/navbarmobile.png">
</details>

</details>

### Home Page

The homepage serves as the central hub of the site, providing visitors with an overview of its offerings, including featured products, testimonials, imagery, and marketing copy. It serves as a gateway to navigate the store sections through shop now navigation links, inviting users to explore further and discover more about the brand's offerings and value propositions. It uses the fold of the screen to showcase branding imagery.

<details><summary>Home</summary>
<img src="./documentation/images/features/homepage.png">
</details>

### Products Page

The products page showcases preview cards of various products, each accompanied by basic descriptions and images, offering users a quick overview of available items. A filtering system based on categories, prices, sales, and ratings, so users can refine their search to find desired products. Additionally, a search bar enables users to explore specific items, enhancing their browsing experience and allowing them to refine very specific requests.

<details><summary>Products</summary>
<img src="./documentation/images/features/productspage.png">
</details>

### Add/Edit Products Page

The Add/Edit products page displays a simple form where moderators or admins can add products to the database. Exisiting products can be edited or deleted. This gives business owners the ability to adjust prices, images, sales and other fields so as to keep an up to date inventory and business model

A design decision was made here to allow moderators to add and edit products as well as superusers/admins. This meant business owners could give potential employees powers to edit inventory but not directly have access to the secure admin portal that had full CRUD functionality.

<details><summary>Add/Edit Products</summary>
<img src="./documentation/images/features/addproducts.png">
</details>

### Programs Page

Similar to the products page, the programs page presents preview cards of different educational programs, providing brief descriptions and images to offer users a glimpse into each program's content and offerings. Searchbar and filtering tools remain consistant with the products page

### Checkout Page

The checkout page streamlines the purchasing process, guiding users through the final steps of completing their orders. Users can review their selected items, input shipping and payment information. Users can add email changes and name changes for orders, but this will only affect a singler purpose. The checkout page provides order summary details, ensuring transparency regarding the total cost, including discounts and shipping fees. Stripe payment elements are used to handle the payment processing.

The checkout page is a two step processed. Verification of delivery address, and then payment verification. I allowed users to have alternate names and emails on orders so they could gift presents and emails with the correct name and email address would be reflected on a single order and not persisted to the database.

## Marketing

The B2C (Business-to-Consumer) ecommerce model is adopted for CISwag as it is an online merchandise and edu platform platform catering to individual consumers looking to purchase a wide array of coding related products or enroll in supplementary education courses.

The main target audience will be software engineering students or existing developers.

Vissta Sphere's marketing strategy will focus on online channels to boost traffic and engagement. There will be an initial setup as seen in this project followed by the hypothesis of a marketing strategy that can be used when payments/business accounts are installed.

### Initial Plan

Facebook will serve as the primary platform, with a dedicated business page promoting products and fostering customer interaction. Posts will be made on the business page as well as information pertaining to the website. A automated bot will be setup to answer FAQ questions.

Additionally, Mailchimp will be utilized for weekly newsletters, updating subscribers on new offerings, promotions, and site enhancements. Emails of users can then be input into FB, google and other online providers to build an audience list.

By combining social media outreach with targeted email marketing, Vissta Sphere aims to effectively engage its audience, drive website traffic, and enhance brand visibility in the competitive ecommerce landscape.

### Paid Business Plan

Hypthoesis of a marketing plan for paid business. This will be broken down into 3 keys online providers. This will required GDPR considerations as well as a verified business.

#### Facebook

1. Boosted posts on the business homepage to extend reach
2. Installation of FB pixel throughout the website to capture analytics - CTR - Add To Cart, Purchase
3. Targeted add campaigns based on audience demographics and LLA audience modelling

#### Instagram

1. Reels and Shorts created to showcase products and testimonials
2. Linked to FB pixel for tracking performance metrics

### Google

1. Creating a google business account and updating business directory
2. Google ads for targeting audiences with banner ads and promoted search results
3. Analytics for understanding traffic and audience
4. Installing pixel throughout the website for key metrics

### Subscriptions

A demo subscription model was used in this application, enabling users to subscribe for benefits. Subscribers are billed on a monthly basis. However, since the Stripe account used is for testing purposes, monthly billing is inactive in this iteration, and memberships require a one-time payment.

## Search Engine Optimization SEO

1. Descriptive meta tags were added to the main template, including title, description and keywords.
2. A sitemap was generated using [xml-sitemaps](https://www.xml-sitemaps.com/) This was generated using the deployed website. The file is included in the root level of the project.
3. Robots.txt file was created at the root level of the project. This file tells the search engine crawlers which URLs they can access on the website.

Future creation of a Google business account will improve SEO performance and website ratings.

- [Heroku](https://heroku.com/) was the hosting provider used.

## Deployment

### Pre Deployment

To ensure the application is deployed correctly on Heroku it is mandatory to update the requirements.txt. This is a list of requirements that the application needs in order to run.

- To create the list of requirements we use the command pip3 freeze > requirements.txt. This will ensure the file with the requirements is updated.
- Then commit and push the changes to GitHub.

! Before pushing code to GitHub ensure all credentials are in an env.py file, which is included in the .gitignore file. This tells Git not to track this file which will prevent it from being added to Github and the credentials being exposed.

### Stripe setup

- Log in to [Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-ie)
- Navigate to developers section (link located at the top right)
- Go to API keys tab and copy the values of PUBLIC_KEY and SECRET_KEY and add them to your env.py file
- Navigate to the Webhooks page from the tab in the menu at the top and click on add endpoint.
- This section requires a link to the deployed application. The link should look like this https://your_website.herokuapp.com/checkout/wh/
- Choose the events the webhook should recieve and add endpoint.
- When the application is deployed, run a test transaction to ensure the webhooks are working. The events chan be checked in the webhooks page.

### AWS setup

- Log in to [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)

1. Create a new S3 bucket:

- Choose the closest AWS region.
- Add unique bucket name.
- Under Object Ownership select ACLs enabled to allow access to the objects in the bucket.
- Under Block Public Access settings unselect block all public access as the application will need access to the objects in the bucket.
- Click on create bucket.

2. Edit bucket settings.

- Bucket properties
  - Open the bucket page.
  - Go to properties tab and scroll down to website hosting and click on edit.
  - Enable static website hosting
  - Under the Hosting type section ensure Host a static website is selected.
  - Add Index.html to index document field and error.html to error document field and click save.
- Bucket permissions

  - Navigate and Click on the "Permissions" tab.
  - Scroll down to the "CORS configuration" section and click edit.
  - Enter the following snippet into the text box and click on save changes.

  ```

          "*"
      ],
      "ExposeHeaders": []
  }
  ]
  ```

  - Scroll to bucket policy section and click edit. Take note of the bucket arn (Example: arn:aws:s3:::test-bucket)
  - Click on policy generator and set the following settings:

    1. Select Type of Policy - S3 Bucket Policy
    2. Effect Allow
    3. Principal \*
    4. AWS Service Amazon S3
    5. Actions: GetObject
    6. Amazon arn: your arn from the previous page

  - Click on add statement and then generate policy.Copy the policy
  - Paste the policy into the bucket policy editor.
  - Add "/\*" to the end of the resource key to allow access to all resources in this bucket.
  - Navigate and Click Save changes.
  - For the Access control list (ACL) section, click edit and enable List for Everyone (public access) and accept the warning box. If the edit button is disabled, you need to change the Object Ownership section above to ACLs enabled (refer to Create Bucket section above).

3. Identify and Access Management (IAM)

- Create User group
  - In the search bar, search for IAM.
  - On the IAM page select user groups in the menu on the left.

    Copy the bucket ARN a second time into the "Resource" section of the JSON snippet. This time, add "/_" to the end of the ARN to allow access to all resources in this bucket.

  ```
      {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
          {
              "Effect": "Allow",
